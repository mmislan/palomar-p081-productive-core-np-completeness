# Base space complexity classes

This file defines the parametric space complexity classes `DSPACE(S)` and
`NSPACE(S)`, the building blocks from which polynomial and log-space classes
are derived.

Work-tape head positions are bounded directly. The finite input region and its
first trailing blank are free, while farther input-head travel is charged. The
output verdict cell is free, while farther two-way output-head travel is also
charged. This prevents either infinite named tape from becoming hidden workspace.
